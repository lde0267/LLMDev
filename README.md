I created a chatbot with a unique, "hood-like" personality!

Personalizing the Chatbot:
Using database.py, you can assign any personality you want to the chatbot. This allows you to tailor the botâ€™s behavior to your preference.

Adjusting Prompts:
You can easily modify the chatbot's prompts by editing the prompts.py file.

Exporting Scripts:
The chatbot can upload conversation scripts in PDF format for easy sharing or review.
